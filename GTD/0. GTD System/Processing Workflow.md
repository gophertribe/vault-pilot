# GTD Processing Workflow

## The GTD Process

### 1. Capture
- Use inbox for everything
- Don't evaluate during capture
- One trusted system

### 2. Clarify
Ask these questions for each inbox item:
- **What is it?** - Define clearly
- **Is it actionable?** - Yes/No decision
- **If YES**: What's the next action?
- **If NO**: Trash, Someday/Maybe, or Reference

### 3. Organize
Based on clarification:
- **Next Actions** → Context folders (@calls, @computer, etc.)
- **Projects** → Projects folder with next actions identified  
- **Waiting For** → @waiting folder
- **Someday/Maybe** → Someday/Maybe folder
- **Reference** → Reference folder

### 4. Reflect
- **Daily**: Review calendar and next actions
- **Weekly**: Complete weekly review process
- **Monthly**: Review areas of responsibility
- **Quarterly**: Review goals and directions

### 5. Engage
- Choose actions based on:
  - Context (where you are, tools available)
  - Time available
  - Energy level
  - Priority

## Quick Decision Tree

```
New Item → Is it actionable?
    ↓ NO → Trash / Reference / Someday Maybe
    ↓ YES → What's the next action?
        ↓ Will it take < 2 minutes?
            ↓ YES → Do it now
            ↓ NO → Can I do it myself?
                ↓ NO → Delegate (→ @waiting)
                ↓ YES → Defer to appropriate context
```

## Context Guidelines

### @calls
- Phone/video calls
- Need: Phone, quiet space
- Best time: Business hours

### @computer  
- Online tasks, coding, writing
- Need: Computer, internet
- Best time: Focused work blocks

### @errands
- Shopping, appointments, outside tasks
- Need: Transportation, specific locations
- Best time: Group by location/route

### @home
- Household tasks, personal projects
- Need: Home environment, tools
- Best time: Evenings, weekends

### @office
- Work-specific tasks
- Need: Office environment, work tools
- Best time: Business hours

### @waiting
- Items dependent on others
- Need: Follow-up system
- Best time: Weekly review check

## Processing Tips
1. Process inbox completely (to zero)
2. Never put anything back in inbox
3. If it takes less than 2 minutes, do it now
4. One action per note for clarity
5. Make next actions specific and verb-based
6. Review contexts regularly, not projects
7. Trust the system - don't keep mental lists
